Installing DataVision
=====================

This file contains the super-abbreviated set of instructions for
installing, configuring, and running DataVision. For full instructions, see
the manual in the docs directory starting at
docs/DataVision/DataVision.html.

DataVision depends upon JDBC drivers to communicate with databases. You
must have the correct driver for each type of database (Oracle, PostgreSQL,
mySQL, ODBC, etc.) that you wish to use.


Installing
----------

Extract the distribution. This creates a directory named
datavision-<version> (where <version> is the DataVision version number).

    tar -xzf datavision-<version>.tar.gz

Configuring
-----------

Edit the file datavision.sh (Unix) or datavision.bat (Windows). For each
JDBC driver you wish to use, add the path to that JDBC driver to the
CLASSPATH.

Running
-------

From a GUI, double-click the appropriate script (datavision.sh for Unix,
datavision.bat for Windows).

From the command line:

	Unix

    cd datavision-<version>
    ./datavision.sh [xml_file...]

	Windows

    cd datavision-<version>
    datavision.bat [xml_file...]

There are many command line options documented in the manual.
