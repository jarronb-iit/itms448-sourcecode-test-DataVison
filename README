Introduction
============

DataVision is an Open Source reporting tool similar to Crystal Reports.
Reports can be designed using a drag-and-drop GUI. They may be run, viewed,
and printed from the application or exported as HTML, XML, PDF, LaTeX2e,
DocBook, or tab- or comma-delimited text files. The output files produced
by LaTeX2e and DocBook can in turn be used to produce PDF, text, HTML,
PostScript, and more.

DataVision is written in Java and runs almost anywhere. It can generate
reports from databases or text data files. Any database with an available
JDBC driver should work: Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Informix, hsqldb,
Microsoft Access, and more. Columns read from text files can be separated
by any character.

Report descriptions are stored as XML files. This means you can not only
use the DataVision GUI but you may also edit reports using your favorite
text editor.

DataVision was developed by Jim Menard (jimm@io.com). The project's leader is
now Frank W. Zammetti (fzlists@omnytex.com). The latest version of DataVision
can be found on the DataVision Web page at http://datavision.sourceforge.net.
New releases are also announced on Freshmeat (http://freshmeat.net) and on the
DataVision mailing list (http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=33343).

Miscellaneous Last-Minute Notes
===============================

For the most up-to-date notes, see the DataVision Web page.

There's one more thing that's not yet documented, but you may want to play
with: the stuff in jimm/datavision/testdata. There you will find code to
create example databases. The PostgreSQL and mySQL directories work. The
Oracle directory might work, but I'm not sure. You will have to be
logged in as a user that's allowed to create new databases.
