<p>
A report has multiple parts; each part may in turn be made up of multiple
sections (not shown). Report parts are separated by a draggable resizing
bar. In this image, the Report Footer is disabled.
</p>

<p>
Along the left are the names of the sections. The large white areas are
sections containing report fields: database columns, text fields, formulas,
aggregates, and special fields such as the report title or page number.
</p>

<p>
Popup menus (not shown) are available in the left hand labels, sections,
and for each field.
</p>

<p>
This is a picture of the report window. Running a report from within
DataVision uses the Swing layout engine, producing the output you see here.
This output can be sent to a printer.
</p>

<p>
DataVision can also export report results to many different formats: XML,
HTML, PDF, comma- or tab-separated text, LaTeX, and more.
</p>

<p>
When you select one of the field types from the <b>Insert</b> menu on the
design window, this window opens. It contains a tree list containing all
database field types except text labels. Click and drag a field to add it
to the report.
</p>


<p><span class="screen-title">Table Linker Dialog</span></p>
<a href="images/tlink.png">

Use this dialog to create or edit links (joins) between tables. The top
of the window displays a list of joins or links between table columns.
