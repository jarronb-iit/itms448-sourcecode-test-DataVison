<h1>The Anatomy of a Report</h1>

A report is made up of a set of standard headers and footers as well as
the report detail rows. Each part except the details is optional. Each part
contains one or more sections. Each section can be turned on or off
(suppressed) and can force a page break.

The <firstterm>section areas</firstterm> that make up a report are:

<ul>
    <li>Report Header</li>
    <li>Page Header</li>
    <li>Group Header</li>
    <li>Detail</li>
    <li>Group Footer</li>
    <li>Report Footer</li>
    <li>Page Footer</li>
</ul>

Each <firstterm>group</firstterm> has an associated user column or database
column. Records are grouped by that column's value. Column aggregates (sum,
min, max, count, average, standard deviation) may appear in group footers and
in the report footer.

Section areas (or more simply, ``areas'') are made up of one or more
<firstterm>sections</firstterm>. For example, the Group Header area may
contain one or more Group Header sections.

Each section may contains <firstterm>fields</firstterm>. A field may be a
database column, a calculated formula, static text, an aggregate, a
special value like the report's title or the current page number, or a
parameter field that allows you to specify its value at report run time.

Reports can contain other reports, called
<firstterm>subreports</firstterm>. The subreport's query runs each time its
field needs to be output. See <a
href="#subreport"><sec>Subreports</sec></a> below.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a id="reportparts" />
<h2>Report Parts</h2>

The <firstterm>Report Header</firstterm> is printed once at the beginning
of the report on the first page. Report titles are typically placed here.

The <firstterm>Page Header</firstterm> is printed at the top of each page
(but after the Report Header on the first page). Often, column titles are
placed here. In fact, when you drag a database column into the Detail
section, a title is automatically placed in the Page Header for you.

The <firstterm>Group Header</firstterm> is printed before the first row
of data and again each time a group's value changes. Since groups can be
nested, the group header for each group is printed in order.

The <firstterm>Detail</firstterm> area is printed once for each row of data.

The <firstterm>Group Footer</firstterm> is printed just before a group's
value changes, and after the last row of data in the report. Since groups
can be nested, the group footer for each group is printed in reverse order.
Aggregates may be added here.

The <firstterm>Report Footer</firstterm> is printed once at the end of
the report on the last page. This is where end-of-report grand totals
belong.

The <firstterm>Page Footer</firstterm> is printed at the bottom of every
page.

<h3>Section Suppression Procs</h3>

A suppression proc determines if a section should be displayed or not.
Sections are normally displayed always. If you select ``Always hide'' (see
<a href="gui.html#suppressionproc"><sec>The Suppression Proc
Dialog</sec></a>) then the section is always hidden.

A suppression proc can contain a formula. The formula must return a boolean
(true/false) value. For every row, the code is run to determine if the entire
section should be hidden for that row only. When the code returns true, the
section is hidden.

For example, the Ruby code

<codeblock>
({jobs.ID} &amp; 1) == 0
</codeblock>

will return true when jobs.ID is an even number. If attached to a detail
section, then all detail records whose jobs.ID is an even number would be
hidden. That is, only records with odd-numbered job IDs would be displayed.

<note>Note</note>: Aggregates are updated even for hidden or suppressed detail
rows. If you want to avoid aggregating rows, don't retrieve them from the
database or use a formula that returns 0 or some other appropriate value for
rows you want to ignore and aggregate that value instead.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a id="fields" />
<h2>Fields</h2>

A field is a single unit of information, whether a database column,
text, or an image.

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<a id="dbcol" />
<h3>Database Column</h3>

A <firstterm>database column</firstterm> field displays the value of a
column in the database.

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<a id="statictext" />
<h3>Static Text</h3>

A <firstterm>static text</firstterm> field displays a text label.

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<a id="formulafield" />
<h3>Formula Field</h3>

A <firstterm>formula</firstterm> field displays the value of a formula.
Formulas contains chunks of code that are evaluated when the report runs.
Formulas may use the values of any other fields, including other formula.
For more information, see <a href="#formulas"><sec>Formulas</sec></a>.

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<a id="aggrfield" />
<h3>Aggregate</h3>

An <firstterm>aggregate</firstterm> field displays an aggregate (sum, min,
max, count, average, or standard deviation) of all of the values a field takes
on, either within a group or over the entire report. The values may come from
any numeric database column or formula.

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<a id="specialvalfield" />
<h3>Special Values</h3>

A <firstterm>special value</firstterm> field contains one of the
following values:

<dl>
    <dt>Report name</dt> <dd>The report's name, as specified in the <a
    href="gui.html#summarydialog"><sec>``Summary'' Dialog.</sec></a>.</dd>

    <dt>Report title</dt> <dd>The report's title, as specified in the
    ``Summary'' Dialog.</dd>

    <dt>Author's name</dt> <dd>The report's author, as specified in the
    ``Summary'' Dialog.</dd>

    <dt>Report description</dt> <dd>The report's description, as specified
    in the ``Summary'' Dialog.</dd>

    <dt>Report run date</dt> <dd>The current date.</dd>

    <dt>Report row number</dt> <dd>The current row number.</dd>

    <dt>Page number</dt> <dd>The current page number.</dd>

    <dt>Group record count</dt> <dd>When put into the detail section, the
    group count is the number of the current record within the innermost
    report group (if there are no groups, it will be the record number
    within the entire report.) When in a group footer, it's the number of
    rows in the group. When in the report footer, it's the total number of
    rows in the report.</dd>
</dl>

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<a id="paramfield" />
<h3>Parameter Field</h3>

A <firstterm>parameter field</firstterm> displays the value of a
parameter. Parameters allows you to specify values at report run time.
Parameters may be used anywhere: in formulas, in the report (as a parameter
field), or for limiting the records selected from the data (the
<guimenuitem>Select Records...</guimenuitem> menu item).

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<a id="imagefield" />
<h3>Image</h3>

An <firstterm>image</firstterm> field displays an image. The value of the
field is either a file path or a URL. Note that a URL of the form
``file:examples/postgresql.xml'' specifies a relative file path. The path
is relative to the DataVision runtime working directory, not relative to
the report XML file.

Currently, only image fields containing image formats understood by the
Java Swing interface (GIF, JPEG) are editable using the DataVision GUI. In
the future you will be able to add any image file format, though it may
display as a simple rectangle if Swing can't display it. (You can manually
edit the report XML and add or edit any image field, of course.)

<!-- ================================================================ -->

<a id="formulas" />
<h2>Formulas</h2>

A formula can execute any code supported by the <a href="#bsf"><sec>Bean
Scripting Framework</sec></a> (BSF). Before being evaluated, the following
substitutions are made to the formula text:

<ul>

    <li>{<var>table_name.column_name</var>} is replaced by the current
    value of the column <var>table_name.column_name</var>.</li>
    
    <li>{@<var>id_number</var>} is replaced by the results of evaluating
    the formula whose id is <var>id_number</var>. (When editing a formula
    the referenced formula's name is displayed, not its id number. The id
    number is used internally.)</li>
    
    <li>{?<var>id_number</var>} is replaced by the value of the parameter
    whose id is <var>id_number</var>. (When editing a formula the
    parameter's name is displayed, not its id number. The id number is used
    internally.)</li>

    <li>{%<var>special_value_name</var>} is replaced by a special value
    (report name, report title, author's name, report description, report
    run date, page number, data row number, or group record count).
    <var>special_value_name</var> is one of the values listed in <a
    href="xml.html#xmlfields"><sec>Fields</sec></a> and described in <a
    href="anatomy.html#specialvalfield"><sec>Special Values</sec></a>.

    <li>{!<var>id_number</var>} is replaced by the value of the user column
    whose id is <var>id_number</var>. (When editing a formula the user
    column's name is displayed, not its id number. The id number is used
    internally.) See <a href="#usercol"><sec>User Columns</sec></a>.</li>

    <li>{|<var>id_number</var>} is replaced by the contents of the detail
    section of the sub-report whose id is <var>id_number</var>.</li>

</ul>

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<a id="bsf" />
<h3>Bean Scripting Framework</h3>

The <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/">Bean Scripting Framework</a>
(BSF) is a Java framework for executing scripting languages that can access
Java objects.

A report is exposed to all formulas as a global object called ``report''. More
information about what you can do with the report object will appear in future
documentation, and some changes to the report object may be made to allow for
access to interesting bits of information.

Each report has a default language, and each formula can use a different
language if it wishes. When a report is first created, its default language is
Ruby. All formulas that do not specify a language use the report's default
language.

<a id="ruby" />
<h4>Ruby</h4>

DataVision ships with JRuby, which is a BSF language that implements Ruby.
Ruby is a scripting language invented by Yukihiro ``Matz'' Matsumoto. See the
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby home page</a> and the <a
href="jruby.sourceforge.net/">JRuby</a> page for more information.

Reports created before DataVision 0.9.0 (when the BSF was introduced) will
continue to work with Ruby and no changes are necessary to continue using
Ruby.

In Ruby scripts, the BSF report object is in a global variable called
<code>$report</code> (``$'' identifies global variables in Ruby).

This document is not an appropriate place for an introduction to Ruby. I
highly recommend ``Programming Ruby'' by David Thomas & Andrew Hunt,
published by Addison Wesley Longman. This book is <a
href="http://www.rubycentral.com/book/">online</a> and is published
under the Open Publication license. The second edition of the book, though not
available for free, is an excellent follow-up well worth the money.

<a id="add-other-lang" />
<h4>Adding another language</h4>

If you want to use a different language you will have to take a few steps.

<ul>

<li>Get the proper jar file for that language.</li>

<li>Put the jar file in DataVision's class path, for example by editing
datavision.sh or datavision.bat. See <a
href="install.html#classpath"><sec>Setting the Java Class Path</sec></a> for
details.</li>

<li>Add the language to the list of languages in the report's XML file. See <a
href="gui.html#scriptlang"><sec>The Formula Languages Dialog</sec></a>.</li>

</ul>


<!-- ................................................................ -->
<a id="startup" />
<h3>Startup Script</h3>

There is one special formula that is evaluated at the beginning of each report
run. It is called the startup script, and can be edited by opening the <a
href="gui.html#startupdialog"><sec>Startup Script dialog</sec></a> from the
<guimenu>Report</guimenu> menu. Any BSF variables you set in this
script are available to all of the rest of your formulas. <note>Note: for the
same language only, I think, not all other BSF languages.</note>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a id="parameters" />
<h2>Parameters</h2>

<note>More needs to be written.</note>

Create parameters using the Field Picker window. Select <guimenuitem>New
Parameter...</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Field</guimenu> menu.

Drag parameters into the ``Select Records'' dialog or onto the report to
use them. When a report that contains parameters is run, you will be asked
to supply values for those parameters.

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<a id="paramexample" />
<h3>Example</h3>

Open the example report, then select <guimenuitem>Select
Records...</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Report</guimenu> menu. Type
``office.name = {?String Param}'' and click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. The
``{?String Param}'' is the name of one of the parameters defined in the
report XML file. (Alternately, you can open the Field Picker window and
drag the ``office.name'' database field and the ``{?String Param}''
parameter from the list of items.)

Run the report. You will be asked to supply a string value. Accept the
default value, ``Chicago''. The report will only display records whose
office name matches ``Chicago''.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a id="usercol" />
<h2>User Columns</h2>

A user column is arbitrary SQL text. The text is insert into the SQL query
as a column to be retrieved. For example, if you define a user column with
the text ``my_stored_proc({?My Parameter})'' then the SQL query will look
something like

<codeblock>
select col1, col2, ..., my_stored_proc(<var>the param value</var>)
from table1, table2, ...
where ...
</codeblock>

Before being inserted into the SQL statement, the following
substitutions are made to the user column text:

<ul>

    <li>{<var>table_name.column_name</var>} is replaced by
    <var>table_name.column_name</var>. Though you can simply add the column
    name, you shouldn't. DataVision needs that extra hint to figure out
    what tables and columns are used in the report.</li>
    
    <li>{?<var>id_number</var>} is replaced by the value of the parameter
    whose id is <var>id_number</var>. (When editing a formula the
    parameter's name is displayed, not its id number. The id number is used
    internally.)</li>

    <li>{%<var>special_value_name</var>} is replaced by a special value
    (report name, report title, author's name, report description, report
    run date, page number, data row number, or group record count).
    <var>special_value_name</var> is one of the values listed in <a
    href="xml.html#xmlfields"><sec>Fields</sec></a> and described in <a
    href="anatomy.html#specialvalfield"><sec>Special Values</sec></a>.

</ul>

Formulas are not allowed within user columns because their values may be
undefined when the query is run.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a id="subreport" />
<h2>Subreports</h2>

A subreport is a report within a report. The subreport's query runs each
time the subreport's field needs to be output. Subreports are only allowed
in reports that have database data sources.

When you import a subreport, you define one or more joins that link the
master report to the subreport. The first column of each join will be
filled with the current value of that column in the master report. The
second will be a SELECT column for the sub-report. For example, selecting
``office.name <= office.name'' will fill the first office.name with the
current value of the office name from the master report. Let's say the
master report's office name value is currently 'Chicago'. The sub-report's
query will then contain a WHERE clause that ends with ``... AND 'Chicago'
<= office.name''.

See <a href="edit.html#subreports"><sec>Subreports</sec></a> in
<sec>Editing a Report</sec> for instructions on adding a subreport to a
report.

<note>Many thanks to Aaron Kardell and Altona Ed, LLC, who funded
development of subreports in DataVision.</note>
