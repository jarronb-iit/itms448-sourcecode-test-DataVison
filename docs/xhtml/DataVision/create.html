<h1>Creating a New Report</h1>

To create a new report, either start DataVision without specifying a
report XML file or select <guimenuitem>New</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>File</guimenu> menu.

Reports retrieve data from <firstterm>data sources</firstterm>. A data
source can be either a database or a comma- or tab-separated file. Each
data source has a different way of specifying the metadata (tables,
columns, and column data types) available for reports.

A database data source reads table and column metadata from the database.

A ``charsep'' data source reads column metadata from the report XML file,
either directly or indirectly. See <a
href="xml.html#element-charsep"><sec>charsep</sec></a> for the gory details.
When using a charsep data source, the ``Select Records'' text which is
normally added to a SQL query's WHERE clause is instead evaluated as a <a
href="anatomy.html#bsf"><sec>Bean Scripting Framework</sec></a> script. The
result is used to determine if a record is used or ignored.

<note>Not yet implemented:</note> When you first create a new report,
DataVision asks you which kind of data source you will be using.

<h2>Connecting to a Database</h2>

When you first create a new report, a dialog box will appear asking you
how to connect to the database. Either copy this information from an
existing report (everything but the password, which is not stored with a
report) or specify the information directly. In either case, you will be
asked to supply a database password each time you open a report.

To copy the database connection information, click the <guibutton>Copy
Settings...</guibutton> button. An ``Open File'' dialog box will let you
choose a report XML file from which the settings will be copied.

There are five pieces of information you need to supply: the JDBC driver
class name, the connection info string, the database name, your database
user name, and your database password. When saving a report, all but the
password are stored in the report XML file.

<b>JDBC driver class name</b> You should be able to find the JDBC driver
class name from your database driver documentation. There are examples for
some databases below.

<b>Connection info string</b> You should be able to find the JDBC
connection info string from your database driver documentation. It will
probably contain either the name of the database schema or the ``sid''.
Sometimes it is the same as the database name. As an example, to connect to
my PostgreSQL database named ``jobs'' I use the driver class name
<class>org.postgresql.Driver</class> and the connection info string
``jdbc:postgresql:jobs'' (without the quotes).

<b>Database name</b> Sometimes called the schema name, the database name
refers to a set of database tables. (This isn't the name ``Oracle'' or
``PostgreSQL''.) When DataVision asks the database for the list of table
names, it uses the database name to specify which tables to return.

<b>Database user name</b> This is the user name you use to connect to
the database. It is not necessarily the same as your computer login
name.

<b>Database password</b> You must enter the database password each time
you open a report.

<h3>PostgreSQL</h3>

The document <a href="http://jdbc.postgresql.org/doc.html">PostgreSQL
JDBC Documentation</a> describes the format of the connection string.

<ul>

    <li>jdbc:postgresql:<var>database</var></li>

    <li>jdbc:postgresql://<var>host</var>/<var>database</var></li>

    <li>jdbc:postgresql://<var>host</var>:<var>port</var>/<var>database</var></li>

</ul>

If left out, <var>host</var> defaults to localhost (not 127.0.0.1) and
<var>port</var> to PostgreSQL's default port number (normally 5432, but
configurable at build time).

The database name (or schema name) in newer versions of PostgreSQL seems to
default to ``public''. You may want to try that in the database name field.
I admin that ``Schema Name'' may have been a better name for that field.
For example, my connection info string is ``jdbc:postgresql:dv_example''
and the database name I use is ``public''.

<h3>MySQL</h3>

The old MM.MySQL driver is now the official driver for MySQL. It's name and
Web locations have changed. It is now called Connector/J and it is
available at <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/connector-j/">the
Connector/J Web site</a>.

<b>Older notes:</b>

If you use either the <file>mm.mysql-2.0.X-bin.jar</file> or
<file>mysql_comp.jar</file> drivers, the driver class name should be
``org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver''.

The format of the connection string must be
``jdbc:mysql://<var>host</var>/<var>database</var>''. The host name is not
optional. If the MySQL database is on the same machine as DataVision, use
the host name ``localhost''.

One user reported trouble with the MySQL JDBC drivers until he switched
to version 2.0.11. The latest version of the MySQL JDBC driver is available
on its <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15923">SourceForge
project page</a>.

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<a id="oracle" />
<h3>Oracle</h3>

Try the driver class name ``oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver''.

The connection info string will depend upon the type of JDBC driver you are
using. For the thin driver, try
``jdbc:oracle:thin:@<var>host</var>:1521:<var>sid</var>''. <var>host</var>
can be ``localhost'' or ``127.0.0.1'' if the Oracle database is running on
the same computer. 1521 is the default port number; that will only be
different if the Oracle database was configured to use a different one. The
``sid'' is a string that identifies where to find the database. It is not
necessarily the same as the database name.

<h3>ODBC</h3>

The vanilla JDBC-ODBC bridge should work just fine.

From a post on the Usenet news group comp.lang.java.databases:

<blockquote>

The <a href="http://industry.java.sun.com/products/jdbc/drivers">Sun driver
list</a> contains all the SQLServer JDBC drivers. You might want to have a
look at the Merant DataDirect JDBC drivers. Free eval type 3 and 4 drivers
are available at <a
href="http://www.merant.com/datadirect/">www.merant.com/datadirect</a>.

</blockquote>

I have read that Microsoft is developing a type-4 JDBC driver. It was in
beta as of February 2002, and was available for download from their SQL
Server pages.

John Kos of <a href="http://www.easysoft.com/">Easysoft</a> writes:

<blockquote>

The Easysoft JDBC-ODBC Bridge server software is predominantly used to
access Windows databases such as MS Access and SQL Server or databases
hosted on other platforms for which a JDBC driver is not available i.e.
ISAM files. In these circumstances the server component will be installed
on a Windows device. (Note: unlike the Sun bridge Easysoft is a type 3
driver and therefore DataVision can run on any remote device, no local ODBC
driver is required).

To configure DataVision you will need:

<dl>

<dt><var>SERVER</var></var></dt>
<dd>the name of the Windows server hosting the Easysoft JDBC-ODBC
Bridge</dd>

<dt><var>DSN</var></dt>
<dd>the name of the target datasource on server_name</dd>

<dt><var>LOGIN</var></dt>
<dd>a Windows user for <var>SERVER</var> (with correct privs)</dd>

<dt><var>PASSWORD</var></dt>
<dd>the Windows password for the above user</dd>

</dl>

<b>Adding the driver to the class path</b>

Copy the file <file>EJOB.jar</file> to the client device and add to the
<code>CLASSPATH</code> by editing <file>Datavision.bat</file>. By default
<file>EJOB.jar</file> will be found in <file><dir>C:\Program
Files\Easysoft\Easysoft JDBC-ODBC Bridge\jars\</dir>EJOB.jar</file>.

<b>Establishing the connection</b>

<dl>

<dt>Driver Name</dt><dd>easysoft.sql.JobDriver</dd>

<dt>Connection Info</dt>
<dd>jdbc:easysoft://<var>SERVER</var>/<var>DSN</var>:logonuser=<var>LOGIN</var>:logonpassword=<var>PASSWORD</var></dd>

<dt>Database Name</dt><dd><var>DSN</var></dd>

<h2>Adding Fields and Text</h2>

This section gives a brief description of how to add database fields and
text to a report. For details, see <a href="edit.html"><sec>Editing a
Report</sec></a>.

To add database fields to a report, select <guimenuitem>Database
Field...</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Insert</guimenu> menu. The Field
Picker window will open. Notice that the first item in the window is
``Database Fields'' and the last item is ``All Database Fields''. In a
newly created report, the first ``Database Fields'' item will be empty,
because it displays database columns that are already in the report.

Double-click ``All Database Fields''. A list of all of the database's
tables will appear. Double-click on a table to reveal the columns within
that table.

Drag a column name from the Field Picker window into the report. As an
added bonus, when you drag a database column into a ``Detail'' section, the
name of the column will automagically appear in the ``Page Header''
section.

To add text to a report, select <guimenuitem>Text</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Insert</guimenu> menu. The cursor will change to a text cursor.
Click anywhere on the report, and a new empty text field will appear. Start
typing the text.

To finish entering text, click anywhere outside of the text field.
