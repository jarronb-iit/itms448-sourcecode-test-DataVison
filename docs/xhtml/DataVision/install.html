<h1>Installing DataVision</h1>

This section walks you through the installation process. Before creating
or running reports, you need to perform a few one-time operations:

<ol>
    
    <li>Install Java.</li>

    <li>Install DataVision.</li>

    <li>Find and install JDBC drivers for each database you will be
    using.</li>
  
    <li>Determine and set the proper Java class path to use when launching
    DataVision (not always necessary).</li>
  
</ol>

For each database you add after installing and configuring DataVision,
you will have to perform the last two steps again.

<!-- ================================================================ -->

<h2>Requirements</h2>

Aside from JDBC database drivers, DataVision requires Java version 1.4
or higher to run.  The instructions for installing Java are beyond the
scope of this document. For more information, see <a
href="http://java.sun.com/">Sun's Java site</a>.

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<a id="installing" />
<h2>Installing DataVision</h2>

Extract the distribution from the archive file named
<file>datavision-<var>version</var>.tar.gz</file> (where
<file><var>version</var></file> is a version number like ``1.2.0''). When
you do, a directory named <dir>datavision-<var>version</var></dir> is
created. You may create or move this directory anywhere you wish.

To extract the DataVision distribution from the command line, type
<command>tar -xzf datavision-<var>version</var>.tar.gz</command>.

To extract the DataVision distribution from a GUI-based program such as
WinZip, open the file <file>datavision-<var>version</var>.tar.gz</file> by
clicking or double-clicking the file or from within the running
application. What happens next will depend upon your operating system and
supporting applications. The directory may be extracted automatically for
you; you may be asked where to put it first. Alternately, the DataVision
archive may be opened and you may need to extract all the files
yourself.

<h2>Finding and Installing JDBC Drivers</h2>

DataVision depends upon JDBC drivers to communicate with databases. You
must have the correct driver for each type of database (Oracle, PostgreSQL,
MySQL, hsqldb, ODBC, etc.) that you wish to use. 

Many drivers may be found by looking on the database developer's Web
site. Here is a list of useful URLs.

<ul>
    
    <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdbc/">The Sun JDBC
    page</a>.</li>
    
    <li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a>.</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>.</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>.</li>

    <li>MySQL JDBC drivers at <a
    href="http://www.mysql.com/">mysql.com</a>; get the latest version of
    the MM.MySQL driver from that project's <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15923">SourceForge
    downloads page</a>.</li>
    
    <li><a href="http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net/">hsqldb</a>.</li>
    
    <li>Other: ODBC drivers are easy to find for Windows platforms, harder
    for Unix. To find JDBC drivers, try searching for phrases like ``mysql
    jdbc driver linux'' or ``odbc jdbc driver linux'' on a search engine
    such as <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>.</li>

</ul>

See <a href="create.html#dbconn"><sec>Connecting to the
Database</sec></a> for more information about particular drivers, including
some issues that users have found.

<h2>Setting the Java Class Path</h2>

A <firstterm>class path</firstterm> is a list of directories or
<firstterm>jar files</firstterm> that Java searches to find all the files
it needs. (<note>The class path does not need to know about your data
files. It tells the Java run time where to find the class files, images,
and properties files DataVision needs to run.</note>) Though there is a
built-in class path that Java already knows about, that class path does not
include the whereabouts of your JDBC drivers or DataVision itself.

The files <file>datavision.sh</file> (Unix) and
<file>datavision.bat</file> (Windows) set the class path before
running DataVision. You may need to edit the appropriate one and add
the path to your JDBC database drivers.  These files already set the
classpath used by DataVision to include all .jar files in the
<code>./lib</code> directory under the DataVision directory, so if all
your JDBC drivers are there, you do not need to edit the DataVision
classpath at all.

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<a id="cpwindows" />
<h3>Editing the Class Path (Windows)</h3>

If necessary, open the file <file>datavision.bat</file> with a text
editor such as Notepad. We are going to edit the line that looks like

<codeblock>
set DVCLASSPATH=
</codeblock>

Add a semicolon (;) and then the full path to each of your JDBC driver
files not in your <code>.\lib</code> directory to this line,
separating each with a semicolon.  For example, if you have installed
the JDBC driver jar file <file>jdbc.jar</file> in the folder
<dir>c:\foo</dir>, your line will look like

<codeblock>
set DVCLASSPATH=<string>;c:\foo\jdbc.jar&quot;</string>
</codeblock>

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<a id="cpunix" />
<h3>Editing the Class Path (Unix)</h3>

If necessary, open the file <file>datavision.sh</file> with your
favorite text editor.  We are going to edit the line that looks like

<codeblock>
dvclasspath=<string>&quot;&quot;</string>
</codeblock>

Append a colon (:) and the full path to each of your JDBC driver files
not in <code>./lib</code> to this line, separating each with a
colon. For example, if you have installed the JDBC driver jar file
<file>jdbc.jar</file> in the folder <dir>$HOME/foo</dir>, your line
will look like

<codeblock>
classpath=<string>:$HOME/foo/jdbc.jar</string>
</codeblock>
