<h1>Running a Report</h1>

This section describes how to view, save, and print the output of a
report.

For information about running DataVision from the command line, see <a
href="rundv.html"><sec>Starting DataVision</sec></a>.

<!-- ================================================================ -->

<h2>Displaying a Report On-screen</h2>

To view a report, select <guimenuitem>Run Report</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Report</guimenu> menu. A new Report View window opens, displaying
the first page of the report. As more data is loaded, more pages become
available. From this window, you can print a report or export the results
to a file.

If you cancel a report, either by closing the Report View window or
clicking the <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> button in the status dialog, the
report run will be canceled and the Report View window will be closed.

The toolbar contains buttons for printing, exporting, and navigating
between report pages.

<!-- ============================================================ -->

<h2>Saving a Report's Output</h2>

From the Report View window, you may print the report or save its output
in any of the formats allowed by the layout engines. See <a
href="le.html"><sec>Layout Engines</sec></a> for a list of available layout
engines and their file formats.

Alternately, you can run DataVision from the command line, specifying a
layout engine and an optional output file name. See <a
href="rundv.html#runcmd"><sec>Running DataVision from the Command
Line</sec></a> for a command synopsis.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<a id="printing" />
<h2>Printing a Report's Output</h2>

Reports can be printed from within the Report View window or by printing
an output file generated by one of the layout engines.

To print a report from within DataVision, run the report. The
<guimenuitem>Print</guimenuitem> menu item and printer button will become
enabled as soon as the last report page is read. Click either one to print
the report.

While the report is printing, a status dialog displays the page number
being printed. Click <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> to cancel printing.

<h3>Printing from DataVision</h3>

From the Report View window, use <guimenuitem>Print</guimenuitem> from
the <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu to send the report to a printer.
Alternately, you can click the print button on the toolbar.

<!-- Two options: from Swing layout engine and from command line. -->

<h3>Printing a Report Output File</h3>

Printing or viewing an exported output file from the command line is
system dependent. For example, you can use DataVision to generate an HTML
file or a comma-delimited <file>.csv</file> text file. Opening that file
depends upon your system: you can use your favorite Web browser to open and
print the HTML file or a spreadsheet program to open and print the
comma-delimited file.

The LaTeX layout engine produces a LaTeX2e <file>.tex</file> file. This
file is in turn used to produce a device independent <file>.dvi</file>
file, most likely by running the command <command>latex</command>. There
are many tools available to translate either the <file>.tex</file> or the
<file>.dvi</file> file into almost any format you may wish: text, HTML,
PostScript, PDF, and more.

<!-- ................................................................ -->
<h3>Quitting under Mac OS X</h3>

<note>Note</note>: Under Mac OS X, be sure to quit DataVision by
selecting <guimenuitem>Quit</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>File</guimenu>
menu (or its keyboard shortcut) that appears in the Design Window.

Do <em>not</em> use <guimenuitem>Quit</guimenuitem> found in the
<guimenu>jimm.datavision.DataVision</guimenu> application menu at the top
of the screen. Quitting that way does not let DataVision ask you about
saving your report. You will <em>loose all changes</em> that have not been
saved.

DataVision is written to be as cross-platform as possible. That means it
does not take advantage of the ``hooks'' that Apple provides for
interacting with Mac OS X.
