<h1>Databases</h1>


<!-- **************************************************************** -->
<a id="dblist" />
<h2>What databases work with DataVision?</h2>


Any database that has a JDBC driver. This means PostgreSQL, MySQL,
Informix, Oracle, hsqldb, Microsoft Access, Progress, and more.

As of version 0.2.1, DataVision has stopped relying upon the more
advanced JDBC features it used. This means that pretty much any JDBC driver
should work.

For information about driver names and connection info string formats
see your database's JDBC driver documentation. Some suggestions also appear
in the DataVision User's Manual.

<h2>Can DataVision read data from anywhere else?</h2>

Yes. DataVision can read from character-separated text files. There is no
GUI support yet for telling DataVision about the structure of the contents
of the text file; see <a
href="../DataVision/xml.html#element-charsep"><sec>charsep</sec></a> in the
User's Manual for details on how to edit your report XML file to describe
the contents of the file.

Similar to the way that there are multiple layout engines, there are
multiple data sources. Only two are implemented: JDBC databases and
character-separated text files.

<!-- **************************************************************** -->
<a id="binary" />
<h2>Can DataVision handle binary database fields?</h2>

No. The problem with binary fields is that there is no way for
DataVision to know what is in the field: text, an image, music. Even if you
told it what the field contains, DataVision would then have to know about
every image, music, or text format in order to display it properly.

<h2>Where is the latest version of the MM.MySQL driver?</h2>

Some users have had problems with drivers earlier than 2.0.11. You can
find the latest version of the MM.MySQL driver from that project's <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15923">SourceForge
downloads page</a>.

<!-- **************************************************************** -->
<a id="namecase" />
<h2>Why can't DataVision find my database columns any more?</h2>

As of 0.6.0, table and column names in DataVision are case-sensitive. See
<a href="../DataVision/edit.html#namecase"><sec>Database Name Case
Sensitivity</sec></a> for details.

From versions 0.7.3 through 0.7.5, there was a bug that prevented tables
from loading their column desriptions under certain circumstances. You
would see tables in the report, but any tables not in the report would not
load their columns properly when you tried to see their columns in the
Field Picker window.

<h2>Why can't I see my PostgreSQL table's columns?</h2>

Upgrade your PostgreSQL JDBC driver if you are using Java 1.4. At least two
PostgreSQL users were having different problems with PostgreSQL when
upgrading to Java 1.4. They downloaded <a
href="http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/devpgjdbc3.jar">devpgjdbc3.jar</a>
and that seemed to fix their problems.
