<h2>What is DataVision?</h2>

From the <a href="../DataVision/DataVision.html">User's Manual</a>:

<blockquote>

DataVision is an Open Source database reporting tool similar to Crystal
Reports. Reports can be designed using a drag-and-drop GUI. They may be
run, viewed, and printed from the application or exported as HTML, XML,
PDF, LaTeX2e, DocBook, or tab- or comma-delimited text files. The output
files produced by LaTeX2e and DocBook can in turn be used to produce PDF,
text, HTML, PostScript, and more.

DataVision is written in Java and runs almost anywhere. It can generate
reports from databases or text data files. Any database with an available
JDBC driver should work: Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Informix, hsqldb,
Microsoft Access, and more. Columns read from text files can be separated
by any character.

Report descriptions are stored as XML files. This means you can not only
use the DataVision GUI but you may also edit reports using your favorite
text editor.

<h2>Why can't I recompile DataVision?</h2>

If you have no problems compiling datavision but your changes don't take
effect, that is probably because you forgot to re-make the jar file.

<codeblock>
make jar
</codeblock>

The ``jar'' make target depends upon the ``all'' target, which means that
make will recompile DataVision before creating the jar file.

If you try to recompile older versions of DataVision (before 0.7.7) you
will get an error message about a missing directory. The image files used
by DataVision used to be copied into the jar file from another directory
outside of the <dir>datavision</dir> directory.

If you wish, you can extract those files from the
<dir>lib/</dir><file>DataVision.jar</file> file.

<codeblock>
<comment># Make a temporary directory</comment>
mkdir temp
cd temp

<comment># Extract the files in the DataVision jar file</comment>
jar xf ../lib/DataVision.jar

<comment># Move the missing graphics files</comment>
mv toolbarButtonGraphics ../..

<comment># Remove the temporary directory</comment>
cd ..
rm -fr temp
</codeblock>

Don't forget to make the jar file, too. See above.
