<h2>Can I export report data to Excel?</h2>


Yes. Use the comma- or tab-separated export formats. Excel can easily read
either one. A hint: use the extension ``.csv'' for comma-separated files
and ``.txt'' or ``.tab'' for tab-separated.

<h2>Why don't I see images in my HTML export?</h2>

When you create an image field using the DataVision GUI, you can specify
either a URL or a file path. If you specify a file path, it will be saved
as such and turned into a ``file:'' URL when it is read back in.

If you specify a relative file path, that relative file path will be used
in the image tag. If you save the HTML output in a different directory than
the DataVision application, the image won't be displayed because the
relative path name will be incorrect.

<h2>Why are my columns in the wrong order?</h2>

Sometimes fields that are displayed from left to right correctly in the
Swing report window don't come out in the same order when you use the HTML
or character (comma- and tab-separated) layout engines.

Because those layout engines can't place columns visually, the fields
are sorted first by their Y coordinate (height) and then by their X
coordinate (left-to-right position). That means if one of your columns is
even one pixel higher than the others, it will be output first.


Make sure all the fields in a section have the same Y coordinate. You can
either use the ``Align'' feature of the GUI to align the fields' tops or
you can edit the report XML file directly.

Fixing DataVision to handle this situation would be non-trivial. I'd have
to add some fuzzy logic that said ``this column is close enough to all the
others that I shouldn't output it first just because it is only one pixel
higher.''

If you have multiple rows of fields in you section, then you can solve this
a different way. The HTML layout engine is stupid. It does not deal well
with multiple lines in the same section.

To solve this problem, split the header into two sections by selecting
``Insert Section Below''. Put the first line of data in the top section,
and the second line of data in the bottom section.

<h2>What does ``Parameter index out of range'' mean?</h2>

When you define a SQL where clause in the ``Select Records'' dialog, the
text you create can contain parameters. If your parameter is a string, do
<em>not</em> enclose it in quotes. If it is enclosed in quotes, you will
see the error message ``Parameter index out of range'' when you run the
report.
