<p>
DataVision is an Open Source reporting tool similar to Crystal Reports.
Reports can be designed using a drag-and-drop GUI. They may be run, viewed,
and printed from the application or exported as HTML, XML, PDF, Excel, LaTeX2e,
DocBook, or tab- or comma-delimited text files. The output files produced
by LaTeX2e and DocBook can in turn be used to produce PDF, text, HTML,
PostScript, and more.
</p>

<p>
DataVision is written in Java and runs almost anywhere. It can generate
reports from databases or text data files. Any database with an available
JDBC driver should work: Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Informix, hsqldb,
Microsoft Access, Progress, and more. Columns read from text files can be
separated by any character.
</p>

<p>
Report descriptions are stored as XML files. This means you can not only
use the DataVision GUI but you may also edit reports using your favorite
text editor.
</p>

<p>
DataVision was developed by Jim Menard (<a
href="mailto:jimm@io.com">jimm@io.com</a>). The project's leader is now Frank
W. Zammetti (<a href="fzlists@omnytex.com">fzlists@omnytex.com</a>). The latest version of
DataVision can be found on the <a
href="http://datavision.sourceforge.net/">DataVision Web page</a>. New
releases are also announced on <a href="http://freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</a>
and on the DataVision <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=33343">mailing list</a>.
