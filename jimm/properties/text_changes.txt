  It should NOT add menu_insert_subreport_action.

  translations. You don't need to do anything.

* Added SectionPageBreakCommand.on_name and
  SectionPageBreakCommand.off_name.

* Added PaperSizeCommand.name.

* Added FieldStretchCommand.name, but the text is the same as
  FieldResizeCommand.name, so I just copied that text. Assuming your
  translation already had FieldResizeCommand, of course.

* Changed last line of usage message to new two last lines.

0.5.2:

* Added "-w" flag to usage message. Nothing to do, since I copied the "-x"
  XML layout engine flag and changed the word "XML" to "Swing".

* Added ColumnField.the_column and ColumnField.column_unknown. Copied
  values from ReportReader.the_column and ReportReader.column_unknown, so
  there is nothing to do.

  edit menu." down to the bottom of the file are new.
